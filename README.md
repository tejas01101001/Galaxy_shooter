# Galaxy_shooter

This project was created to have a deeper insight on how games actually work.
Used extensive C# object oriented programming concepts and used unity to get all the objects together in a visual mode.
In this game, A player has 3 lives and his target to kill as many enemies as possible using lazer before the player dies.
The enemies were auto spawnned at regular intervals using ienumerator coroutine.
The player is awarded 10 points for each kill and whenever a enemy hits the play the player loses its one life.
Added Beautiful sound effected using unity engine.
